Looks good!

## Homework 15 feedback

Good and nice job separating coding comments inside of code chunks (though you could use more of them!) from thought flow outside of code chunks.

## Homework 16 feedback

You used 'as.Date()' from base R (line 41) to convert Date into a date format, which is fine, but what we went over in class was how to do it with lubridate, which is a bit easier. You might want to go back and look at those notes (from before we started learning git/github. Other than that, looks great!
