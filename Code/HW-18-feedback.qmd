## Homework 18 feedback

Line 14 - `library(dplyr`) is not needed because `dplyr` loads with `tidyverse`

This looks good. I'd like to see you do more to add commentary about the what/why of what you are working on, outside of code chunks, and more comments on what the code is actually doing inside of code chunks.

For example, line 129 is good on the what/why of what you are doing, but inside your code chunk, you might want to add a comment that the `facet_wrap` line is the one that makes the matrix of graphs.
